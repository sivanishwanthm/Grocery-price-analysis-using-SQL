# Grocery-price-analysis-using-SQL
The goal of this project is to implement various SQL queries on a Fruits and Vegetables Prices in USA dataset to return interesting insights about the dataset. This dataset includes information such as item names, forms, retail prices etc. This project aims to uncover interesting facts and patterns within the data, providing valuable information related to the economic aspects of various food items. This analysis could be used to understand pricing trends, yield variations and other factors in this domain.
This project provides a platform to apply and test key concepts learned in class like:
•	Demonstrating the ability to design a conceptual model that represents the relationships and entities within the real-world food dataset.
•	Translation the conceptual model into SQL schema by creating appropriate tables. This involves mapping the conceptual entities and relationships to their corresponding database structures.
•	Implementing the SQL schema by creating tables that accurately represent the dataset. This involves considering data types, constraints and relationships.
•	Demonstrating proficiency in writing SQL queries tailored for specific data retrieval purposes. This includes extracting meaningful insights from the dataset to address relevant economic questions.
